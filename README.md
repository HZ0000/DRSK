# Implementation

For the experiments on the Computer Communication Network:
To obtain the ground-truth data (without MCMC), run experiment - 2022 setting1truth/experiment - 2022 setting2truth/experiment - 2022 setting3truth, and obtain data that are similar to CF1-truth.csv/CF2-truth.csv/CF3-truth.csv  <br />
